# Svbmit

This is a client-side form library for Svelte. It's in early developement so expect bugs, changes, and dragons.

Demo app: https://svbmit.netlify.app/

To install:

```
npm i svbmit
```

## Main features
* Lightweight (aprox 3kB gzip).
* No dependencies other than Svelte.
* The DOM is the ultimate source of truth for values. You have total freedom to modify the DOM for complex forms. This library will figure it out.
* You can use in-browser native validation for the most common use cases (eg: required fields).
* Validation is sync (custom or native).
* You can add per-field external validation. This allows you to implement cancealable async validators.
* Control when errors are displayed to custom-tailor the user experience.

## Simple example
```svelte
<script>
  import {controller} from 'svbmit';
  import {writable} from 'svelte/store';

  const settings = {
    async onSubmit (values) {
      console.log(values)
    }
  }

</script>

<form use:controller={settings}>
  <input type="email" name="email" required>
  <input type="password" name="password" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Validation

Validation happens on every event (`input`, `blur`, etc). The `controllerState` is always updated with the current state of the complete form. Check the demo app to get an idea of what this means.

### Valid and invalid CSS classes

Once a field is considered to be valid or invalid, its input will be marked with a CSS class. By default these are `valid` and `invalid` but you can configure custom CSS class names (eg: `is-valid` and `is-invalid` if you're using Bootstrap).

You can completely deactivate this behavior by using `null` for the `validClass` and/or `invalidClass` settings.

The valid CSS class will not be applied to checkboxes, select, and radio inputs. You can change this behavior with the `addValidClassToAllInputs` setting.

### Displaying errors

Other than the CSS classes mentioned before, this library will not display any errors for you.

You can pass a Svelte writable on the initial configuration which will be updated with the currently displayed errors.

### When are errors displayed?

Although the library knows the state of the complete form at all times, errors are not always displayed. There's nothing more annoying than a form nagging you about an incorrect email address when you haven't finished writing it.

This is the default behavior:

* Errors are always displayed when submitting the form.
* Errors are never displayed when interacting with the form.
* If a field is displaying an error, it will be hidden once the user changes the field's value.
* `blur` and `focus` events will not hide an error.

See the settings below on customizing the default behavior.

When using the external validation on a field, the library will ignore all the error displaying logic and you will have total control on when to display an error.

### Sync validators

When configuring a field you can add any number of sync validators:

```js
function isAllCaps (value) {
  const regexLowercase = /[a-z]/;
  const testLowercase = regexLowercase.test(value);

  if (testLowercase) return 'Only use uppercase letters';
  return true;
}

const formControllerSettings = {
  async onSubmit (values) {},
  fields: {
    titleInCaps: {
      validators: [isAllCaps]
    }
  }
}
```

In your validator, return `true` if the value is valid. Anything other than `true` will mark the field as invalid, and whatever you return will be available in the `controllerState` and `displayedErrors` stores.

### External validators

You can add a per-field external validator which will have full control over the validation of a field:

```js
function checkDomainIsAvailable (fieldState, eventType, update) {
  // do your thing
}

const formControllerSettings = {
  async onSubmit (values) {},
  fields: {
    domain: {
      externalValidator: checkDomainIsAvailable
    }
  }
}
```

* `fieldState` is the current state of the field (value, etc)
* `eventType` is whatever event that triggered the external validator ('submit', 'input', etc).
* `update` is a function you can use to update the state of the field such as marking it valid, invalid, etc.

See the [async validation form](demo-app/src/components/AsyncValidation.svelte) for a full example on how to implement async validation with promise cancelation.

## Dynamic forms

Because the DOM is the source of truth, you can alter it in any way you need. You can add and remove fields dynamically and the state of the library will be updated magically.

See the [dynamic form demo](demo-app/src/components/DynamicForm.svelte) for an example of a dynamic form.

### Name aliases

Field settings are connected to a particular input using its name attribute. This works for the vast majority of use cases, but there are more complex scenarios where this breaks.

For example, imagine you had a field called `productName` with a custom validator to ensure the name is properly formatted:

```js
const formControllerSettings = {
  async onSubmit (values) {},
  fields: {
    productName: {
      validators: [checkNameFormat]
    }
  }
}
```

By default, the `productName` settings would only be applied to this input:

```html
<input type="text" name="productName"/>
```

But what if you wanted to edit multiple products in the same form? What if the number of products was dynamic and you didn't know how many you'd want to edit?

The solution is using name aliases so that you can apply a particular setting to any input:

```html
<input type="text" name="productName|3b761efe-f253-484c-9b56-febf9dcb7268"/>
<input type="text" name="productName|f52ddac8-d46a-42cd-9de3-f84275e786b2"/>
<input type="text" name="productName|9329ff26-90e7-4b01-a1c8-f0ef0d0b0d3a"/>
```

Now all those inputs will use the `productName` settings, but will be treated as different inputs with their own name. In this example, the product id.

See the [dynamic form with custom validation demo](demo-app/src/components/DynamicFormWithCustomValidation.svelte) for a full example on how to use aliases.

## `controller` action settings

Required:
* `onSubmit` a callback function that will be triggered when all validation has passed and the form is submitted.

Optional:
* `fields` an object with field configurations
* `validClass` custom CSS class that will be applied to valid input elements. The default is `valid`. If set to `null` no class will be applied.
* `invalidClass` custom CSS class that will be applied to invalid input elements. The default is `invalid`. If set to `null` no class will be applied.
* `useNativeErrorTooltips` use the browser's error tooltips. Defaults to `false`.
* `displayedErrors` a [Svelte writable](https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_store) that will be updated with displayed errors
* `controllerState` a [Svelte writable](https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_store) that will be updated with the controller state
* `displayErrorsOnBlur` display field errors on `blur` events. The default is `false`.
* `displayErrorsOnChange` display field errors on `change` and `input` events. The default is `false`.
* `hideErrorsOnChange` hide field errors on `change` and `input` events. The default is `false`.
* `addValidClassToAllInputs` add the `validClass` too all types of inputs. The default is `false`.

### Field configurations
All optional:
* `validators` an array with sync functions that will be used to validate the value of the field after the native validators have passed.
* `externalValidator` a sync function that will be used for all validation. When using this option, no validation will be performed by the library itself.
* `displayErrorsOnChange` show field errors on `input` and `change` events. The default is `false`.
