# Svbmit

This is a client-side form library desingned for Svelte. It's in early developement so expect bugs, changes, and dragons.

Demo app: https://svbmit.netlify.app/

To install:

```
npm i svbmit
```

Note: Svbmit is undergoing a heavy rewrite so I have decided to remove the docs until the API is more stable and more features are added.
