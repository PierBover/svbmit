# Svbmit

This is a client-side form library desingned for Svelte. It's in early developement so expect bugs, changes, and dragons.

**Guiding principles**
* HTML-first approach
* UX oriented
* Flexible
* Lightweight

Demo app: https://svbmit.netlify.app/

To install:

```
npm i svbmit
```

Svbmit is undergoing a heavy rewrite so I have decided to remove the docs until the API is more stable and more features are added.

If you're curious, you can check the code of the [demo app](demo-app/src/components) where all features are being used:

* Dynamic forms
* Cross field validation (eg: confirm password)
* Group field validation (eg: age validation of multiple fields)
* How to implement async validation
* File inputs
